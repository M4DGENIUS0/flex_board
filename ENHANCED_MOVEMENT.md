# StackBoardPlus Enhanced Movement System

## Overview

The StackBoardPlus has been enhanced with a new movement system that provides smooth, free movement without grid constraints and a more user-friendly interface.

## Key Improvements

### üéØ **Free Movement**
- Items move smoothly without grid snapping during drag operations
- Real-time position updates for responsive interaction
- No artificial constraints on positioning

### üé® **Enhanced Visual Design**
- Modern, clean handle designs with shadows and rounded corners
- Color-coded handles for different operations:
  - **Blue**: Resize handles
  - **Green**: Rotation handle
  - **Red**: Delete handle
  - **Orange**: Move handle (for small items)

### üñ±Ô∏è **Improved Interaction**
- Dynamic cursor changes based on operation:
  - Grab/Grabbing for movement
  - Resize cursors for scaling
  - Click cursor for rotation and deletion
- Visual feedback with scaling animation on selection
- Proper handle positioning relative to item size

### üìè **Smart Handle System**
- **Corner Handles**: Full diagonal resizing
- **Side Handles**: Horizontal/vertical resizing (appears on larger items)
- **Rotation Handle**: Top-center position for intuitive rotation
- **Delete Handle**: Easy access without accidental clicks
- **Move Handle**: Dedicated handle for small items where dragging might be difficult

## Technical Features

### Controller Enhancements
- `moveItemFree()`: Movement without grid snapping
- `setItemPosition()`: Direct position setting
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing grid-snap functionality

### Widget Architecture
- Modular handle system
- Efficient rendering with minimal rebuilds
- Proper state management for multiple interaction modes
- Animation support for smooth transitions

### User Experience
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Responsive feedback
- Accessibility considerations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Free Movement
```dart
// Items automatically move freely when dragged
// No additional configuration required
FlexBoardConfig(
  enableSnapToGrid: false, // Disable for completely free movement
  showGrid: false,         // Hide grid for cleaner appearance
)
```

### Custom Handle Styling
The new system provides consistent, professional-looking handles that:
- Scale appropriately with item size
- Provide clear visual feedback
- Support all standard operations
- Work well on different backgrounds

### Responsive Design
- Handles adapt to item size
- Small items get dedicated move handles
- Large items get additional side resize handles
- Consistent 20px handle size for optimal touch/mouse interaction

## Migration Notes

- Existing code works without changes
- New movement system is enabled by default
- Grid snapping can still be enabled in configuration
- All callback functions remain the same

## Performance

- Optimized rendering with `RepaintBoundary` where appropriate
- Efficient state management
- Minimal widget rebuilds
- Smooth 60fps animations

The enhanced system provides a more professional and intuitive experience while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing StackBoardPlus implementations.
